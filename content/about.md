Hi, my name is Nikita.
Currently I work as an Embedded software engineer.
Also, have some experience with Fullstack web development.

This is just a small blog where I will document my exploration of interesting technologies. 

I hope it will help me to retain my motivation more easily.
Also, I am planning to showcase some projects here soon. 
Too many projects worth sharing are now buried with old hard drives.
